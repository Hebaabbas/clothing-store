This project is to help a business owners count their products that they have sold and how many they need to bring in order to refill for the next day.

Basically it is a clothing store system.
The max total of items per product in the storage has to alway be 30.
The shop sells 5 different items (shirt, jeans, dress, shoe, bag).
The owner has to give the shop a name and has to be at least 18 years old.
The owner will specificy how many products that were sold after the business day is over and the system will document it as well as it will give the owner information of the total amount of items needed to be refilled for the next business day.
